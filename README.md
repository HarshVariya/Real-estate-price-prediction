# Real-estate-price-prediction
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a property based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc.

Features:

Dataset Cleaning: The dataset undergoes thorough cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies that may affect the performance of the model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (price).
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
Model Training: Utilizing linear regression to train a predictive model on the cleaned dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, etc.
Deployment: Deploying the trained model to make real-time predictions on new data.
Tools and Technologies:

Python: Programming language used for data cleaning, analysis, and model building.
Pandas: Data manipulation library for handling datasets.
NumPy: Library for numerical operations in Python.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library in Python used for training and evaluating the predictive model.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualization libraries for creating insightful plots and graphs.
